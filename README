pybotwar is a fun and educational game where players
write computer programs to control simulated robots.

INTRODUCTION

Your task is to create a computer program to control a
robot for the arena. The last robot alive is the winner.

Robot programs run in separate processes from the main
simulation, and communicate with the main program over
standard input and standard output channels. Theoretically,
this means that the robots could be limited in the amount
of system access they have, and how much of the system's
resources they can consume.

CAUTION!
Right now, that is not the case. Robot programs run
as regular Python programs, using the regular Python
interpreter, and can do anything any other program
can do.

In the future, I intend to implement some kind of
sandboxing for robot programs, but that is not done.



INSTALLATION

Make sure the required dependencies are installed.

pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation,
and uses either pyqt or pygame and pygsear for the
visualization.

Unpack the pybotwar archive and run the program
from the unpacked folder. No installation is needed,
but you may need to change the configuration. See
CONFIGURATION for details.



DEPENDENCIES

python:
    http://python.org/
        (tested with python-2.6.4)

pybox2d:
    http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/
        (tested with pybox2d-2.0.2b1)

pygame (optional):
    http://pygame.org/
        (tested with pygame-1.8.1)

pygsear (optional -- required if using pygame):
    http://www.nongnu.org/pygsear/
        (tested with pygsear-0.53.2)

pyqt4 (optional):
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/
        (tested with pyqt-4.6)


RUNNING

Run the main.py program with Python:

    python main.py

Use the -h option for additional help:

    python main.py -h

    | Usage: main.py [options]
    |
    | Options:
    |   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    |   -T, --testmode        run in test mode
    |   -t, --tournament      run a tournament
    |   -n NBATTLES, --battles=NBATTLES
    |                         number of battles in tournament
    |   -g, --no-graphics     non graphics mode
    |   -Q, --pyqt-graphics   enable PyQt interface
    |   -D, --upgrade-db      upgrade database (WARNING! Deletes database!)


CONFIGURATION

The first time you run pybotwar it will create a blank
configuration file called conf.py

Look in defaults.py to see the values which can be changed.

IMPORTANT NOTE!
Windows users especially will need to change the value for
subproc_python or the program will not run.

Add a line to conf.py like ...

    subproc_python = 'C:/Full/Path/To/Python26.exe'



CREATING NEW ROBOTS

Copy the template.py file to a new file in the robots
folder, for example 'mynewrobot.py'

Add a line to conf.py with the name of your new module:

    mine = 'mynewrobot'

Add your module reference to the robots list:

    robots.append(mine)

Or, if you only want to test your own robot:

    robots = [mine]

You can also run with multiple copies of the same robot:

    # Three copies of example robot 1 and three of my new robot
    robots = [r1, r1, r1, mine, mine, mine]

If you want to run with only your new robot, be sure to
run in test mode, or the battle will be over before it
begins:

    python main.py -T

In your new module, add initialization code to the .initialize()
method if needed, otherwise add a pass statement or delete the
method.

The .initialize() method is called once, immediately after the
robot is created, and must return in less than a second or
the robot will be placed in an error state and removed from
the battle.

Add code to generate your robot's response to the .respond()
method.

The .respond() method will be called 60 times per second as
the battle continues and it must return in less than 0.015
seconds or the robot will be placed in an error state and
removed from the battle.

See the robot.Robot class for useful methods to set the
response, or the example robots for hints on how to use
those methods.

TOURNAMENTS

Robots are placed in the arena at random locations and with
random orientations. Also, many robots will use random numbers
to determine which way to go and when to perform their actions.

Therefore, each time the same set of robots are placed in the
arena, the results may be different.

To determine which robots are truly the strongest, run a
tournament. A tournament is a series of battles run with the
same set of robots. Statistics will be kept during the series
and reported when the series is complete.



HISTORY

pybotwar was inspired by the game RobotWar that existed
for the Apple ][ in the early 1980s. However, the method
of coding is more akin to the style of programs used
for the FIRST robotics competition, where a particular
user-defined method is called repeatedly (60 times
per second in this case) and must finish in a set
amount of time to avoid putting the robot in to an
error state and disabling it.
