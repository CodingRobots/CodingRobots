pybotwar is a fun and educational game where players
write computer programs to control simulated robots.

pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation.
It can be run in text-only mode -- useful for longer
tournaments -- or use pyqt or pygame for a graphical
interface and visualization of the action.

pybotwar is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pybotwar-0.8:
    - PyQt4 view mode is now the default
        - (no graphics and pygame/pygsear still available)
    - Added "robots dir" setting to make it easier to run pybotwar
        from an installed copy, rather than from the unpacked folder
        - logs, lineups, and db all go in robots dir
    - automatically adds .py to robot filename if needed
    - falls back to :memory: database if unable to open file
    - log messages in testmode when using qt4 view
    - made POSition sensor scale same as PING sensor
    - fixed editor backspace between left edge and start of text
    - fixed inability to re-open file once its window was closed
    - fixed crash when cancelling file-open dialog
